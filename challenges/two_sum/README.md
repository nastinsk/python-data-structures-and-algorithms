# Two Sum

## Challenge
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.




## Approach & Efficiency
Time Big O()
Space Big O()

## Input:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,


## Output:
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
