# Get Edge

## Author: Anastasia Lebedeva, Chris Ceder, James Bond

## Challenge
Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.


## Approach & Efficiency
Time Big O()
Space Big O()

## Example
### flights_graph:
![Graph](https://github.com/nastinsk/python-data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/assets/GraphDay27.png)

## Input: flights_graph, ['Metroville', 'Pandora']
## Output: True, $82

## Input: flights_graph, ['Arendelle', 'Monstropolis', 'Naboo']
## Output: True, $115

## Input: flights_graph, ['Naboo', 'Pandora']
## Output: False, $0

## Input: flights_graph, ['Narnia', 'Arendelle', 'Naboo']
## Output: False, $0
