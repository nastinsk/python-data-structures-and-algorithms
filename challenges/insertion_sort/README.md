# Insertion Sort
## Author: Anastasia Lebedeva

## Challenge
Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach & Efficiency

* Space complexity Big O(1)
* Time complexity Big O(n^2)
