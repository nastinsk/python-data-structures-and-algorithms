# Binary search in a sorted 1D array

## Authors: Anastasia Lebedeva, Terrell Douglas

## Challenge
Write a function called binary_search which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

### Example Input ---> Output:
* [4,8,15,16,23,42], 15 ---->  2
* [11,22,33,44,55,66,77], 90 ----> -1


## Approach & Efficiency
In our solution we created function wich takes two arguments(ordered list and search key element).

Big O(log N)
