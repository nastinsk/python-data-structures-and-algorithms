# Reverse an Array

## Authors: Anastasia Lebedeva, Joseph Hangarter

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

### Example Input:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[89, 2354, 3546, 23, 10, -923, 823, -12]

### Example Output:
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
[-12, 823, -923, 10, 23, 3546, 2354, 89]

## Approach & Efficiency
In solution to this challenge we used array methods pop() and insert().
We used one for_loop in our solution wich describes our algorithm as O(N).
