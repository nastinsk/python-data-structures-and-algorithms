## Author: Anastasia Lebedeva, Joseph Hangarter

## Challenge
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value. Return a new tree with the changed values.


## Approach & Efficiency
For the fizz_buzz_tree fucntion:
Time Big O(N)
Space Big O(N*tree_height)
