# Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Author: Anastasia Lebedeva

## Challenge
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.


## Approach & Efficiency

Time Big O(n)
Space Big O(1)
